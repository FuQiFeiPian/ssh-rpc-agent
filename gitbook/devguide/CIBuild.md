# How to build with CI ?

* Tag with release version
```
git tag 0.0.1
git push origin 0.0.1
```

* Travis CI will build image and deployment zip with version you specified by tagging, e.g, `0.0.1` in our case.

* Check the [release page](https://github.com/hellstein/ssh-rpc-agent-server/releases)

* Check the [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hellstein/ssh-rpc-agent-server/tags/)
